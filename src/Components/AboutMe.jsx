            <p>I am that one weirdo who likes learning random topics and complicated concepts. 
                It had been at the back of my mind that I quite enjoyed programming even as I 
                was taking an engineering programme in uni. It wasn't until a few weeks into
                the pandemic that I'd begun to make a career out of it.</p>
            <p>I've found my niche in web development. Very much enamoured I am with JavaScript.
                If I could have it as a lover, I would. So flexible, it is!</p>
            <p>I'm currently working into mastering (or as close to it as possible; no human is 
                omniscient) the MERN stack, as well as Redux, GSAP, and GraphQL along the way.
                I've made React my turf. Have to love Hooks and how I can go wild mixing React and 
                ES6+.</p>
        </div>
